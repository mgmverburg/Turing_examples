This repository contains some practical examples for myself mostly for trying out Turing.

The main one I have added so far originates from a course at Carnegie Mellon University (
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ggordon/10601/) and is located in folder "HW2 CMU". I added the pdf of the homework exercise that I attempt to solve including the solutions, and omitted all the irrelevant parts of the homework exercise. You can always find the original on the website or in an older commit before I removed pages.
